# Immersion 

This is Castel's code from the npm package immersion-presentation he had created. 

You can find more details about this npm package in the [npm repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immersion-presentation).

## Getting started

To get started, install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/). 
Then to initialize a presentation, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app title-of-your-presentation --template immersion
```

This will create a directory named `title-of-your-presentation`.
Once in the directory execute `yarn start` and the presentation will open up in a browser window. Upon changing the contents, the browser will automatically reload.

## Problems?

You may end up seen some errors because the package is not up-to-date. To be able to run, you can reinstall `immersion-presentation` using `--legacy-peer-dips`, 
and intall the new version of `querystring`. Then once again in the directory you can execute `yarn start` and the presentation will open up in the browser window
without errors.
